              To keep your experience safe and positive and eliminate the risk
              of transmission of COVID-19, we are using sanitizing products with
              at least 60% ethanol as per the CDC recommendation to stop the
              spread of COVID-19 on surfaces. Items will also be held for the
              duration of the virusâ€™s half-life on the surface, depending on the
              material.
